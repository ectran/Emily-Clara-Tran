                    <h4>Elementail (In Progress)</h4>
                    <p>Elementail is a rogue-lite elemental-based 2D action platformer game where you play as a cat navigating through various levels and battling enemies. As the player progresses, they unlock different elemental abilities that change their playstyle, helping them prepare for platforming challenges and intense boss fights of varying difficulties. </p>
                    <p>The game is currently in early development as part of a collaborative project with a team of friends. We’re using Unity for game development and Aseprite for creating pixel art and animations. Here’s a sneak peek of the concept art for the main character, along with an idle animation that I’ve worked on. </p>

                    <h4>Sntruggled (In Progress)</h4>
                    <p>Sntruggled is a VR first-person shooter (FPS) zombie survival game where you and your stuffed animal friends fight off endless waves of toys.

                    <p>The game is currently in early development as part of a collaborative project with a team of friends. We’re using Unity for game development, Unity’s free assets for 3D models and animations, and Blender for customization. Although there isn’t much to show yet, I am actively involved in the controller movement, enemy AI, and overall game design. </p>
